Sir John Major, former leader of the Conservative Party and former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, delivered an apiphany of a speech on November 9. "We are no longer a great power," he states; a self-realization beget of the decline of the UK as a nation, former leader of the world. "We are a top second-rank world power." A conservative practically accepting defeat of the UK among the performance stage of the world powers is a tell-tale sign of our own demise of self-perception as a country, and consequently of how other nations continue to perceive us. 

## A run down of the British Empire

The UK has long enjoyed the fruits of its own imperialism for hundreds of years, starting way back with its first colony of the Roanoke Colony (I've excluded Newfoundland as, although itself was a pivotal moment for the country, Roanoke marks the establisment of a "proper" colony in North America). After seeing the successes its rivals Spain and France had, and also by the peoples' avarice, she ventured into founding new colonies and settlements throughout Northern and Central America, through conquest and brutality over the natives in the seventeenth century. 

In an effort to support the expansion, multiple chartered companies were made to pursue further profit out of the current colonies to feed into new ones. Hudson's Bay Company and, most famously, the British East India COmpany, were formed to maximise profit from trade, exploration and colonization.

The seventeenth centure saw huge growth for the British Empire, expanding towards Africa and asserting further dominance across Eastern Asia and the Americas. From this came Britain's entrance into the slave trade, becoming an essential for sustaining the economies for Britain's American colonies. This also served as a crux for the narcisissm and "higher-than-thou" attitude the British population consequently developed, but we shall dive into this later.

This time was embroiled with devastating conflict between Britain and France fighting over colonial areas and dominance over various colonial regions. The North American settlements, for example, were fought over in the Seven Years' War in the middle of the eighteenth centure, which eventually was won by the British. In addition, Britain also assured dominance after victories against France. This helped assert Britian as the ruling hegemon and military force over the Indian subcontinent.

These wins in the eighteenth century were balanced out by the loss of the Thirteen Colonies after defeat of the American War of Independence. Although this did make a dent into Britain's income, this was quickly compensated by new settlements in Australia, Sri Lanka and elsewhere in Africa following the Treaty of Amiens.

By the 19th century, Britain had readily established itself to the world stage, and to its own people, as *The* world superpower and marked its own height. India became Britain's biggest cash-cow following the onset of the Industrial Revolution, rinsing India for all its natural resources to process it with newly-made machinery, and exporting all of its coal back to Britain. Let's not also forget the infamous drug-trafficking expeditions of the East India Company, practically enslaving vast swathes of the Indian and Chinese peoples to Opium and beckoning them with the sins of the poppies.

By the end of the 10th century, the Brits effectively ruled just under a quarter of the world's total land surface.

## The British Arrogance

Given that your country practically owns almost a quarter of the world, it would be natural to have some sort of innate feeling of dominance when it comes to the matters of other countries - of international affairs. The British populance, in particular the bourgeoisie, reveled in this. It was their "mission" to liberate the world free of its backwards ways, submit to Britain and embrace the industrial revolution!

Drawing on the works of Said, we should first define this case of what fueled what we shall call "arrogance". Years of battles between the Christian world and Islamic world grew a hatred for the people of Africa and Asia - they were the "other" and were dirty, filthy, uncivilized and worshippers of a false prophet according to the Europeans.

Upon the establishment of their colonies in the America's introduced the idea that they could freely exploit these lands and their inhibitants. They didn't have the complex architecture London had, they didn't have the grand navies nor did they have the same level of military might as the Britsh.
