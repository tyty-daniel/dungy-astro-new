When I first watched One Punch Man in 2015 I zoned in HARD on Genos. His design (blonde twunk) immediately matched my usual type for anime men. Combine this with the incredible animation of One Punch Man season 1 -- seeing all his robotic parts move around with his focused, handsome faced while his hair is flared out from the wind -- and I was locked in. 

Genos's personality is serious, focused, extremely loyal to Saitama, and feels extremely principled and stubborn. His interactions with Saitama, where he looks up to Saitama as his master and mentor, also helped me sink in a self-insert as Saitama in my head. The wormbrains were out of control for Genos and I may have been a little obsessed with him. 

When season 2 came out the animation quality took a nosedive and I couldn't even bring myself to finishing it. Still I saved all the fanart I could of him. Hopefully when season 3 comes out there will be merchandise that I can buy of him. When I was in Japan I looked in all the second-hand anime good stores and there was nothing of him anywhere.
