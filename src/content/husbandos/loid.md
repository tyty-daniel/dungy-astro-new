Loid Forger came out of nowhere for me when I started to watch Spy X Family. An intelligent, charming spy that also knows how to be a family man. He has peak husband physiognomy which I am extremely attracted to.

Saying this I've stopped watching SPY X FAMILY already, I found the show to be extremely boring going into season 2 and as much as I loved Loid I just really couldn't keep watching it when he doesn't have as much screentime as Anya and Yor. 

Saying this, when I see him I go feral with him being my exact type. Love me a blonde man.
