Thoma is my #1 husbando (with Kisumi Shigino following very closely behind). I would watch YouTube videos of his cutscenes every now and then and obssessively like his fanart on Twitter. I remember when he first got leaked on Twitter and everyone thought he was going to be a cocky, jock-type character, but then turned out to be the most housewife-esque character in the game. How he is the fixer in the village and knows everyone, how he is the most wholesome character in the game.

## Merchandise
I have a body pillow of Thoma illustrated by <a href="https://linktr.ee/minoru_uwutemp">minoru_uwutemp</a> (no longer sold) which I have used for over 2 years now.

This is in addition to various other keychains and acrylic stands I purchased from Japan.

## Birthday Meal 
Thoma's birthday meal is a tofu miso soup. Every year since his release I've made sure to have miso soup on his birthday (or close enough to his birthday as possible).
