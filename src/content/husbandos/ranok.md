Ranok is the main character and love interest in the visual novel Far Beyond The World. A 7'1" wolfman and son of the village chief, he is an affectionate and almost overbearingly caring man. With Far Beyond The World being a romance visual novel, Ranok is quickly attracted to you and you navigate a situationship-turned-relationship with him while hiding this within the village. 

Even with this stress of hiding the relationship, Ranok is head over heels in love with you, and his loving personality with the codepedent relationship you have with him make you quickly fall for him too. Deeply so. 

I first started playing FBTW during the second lockdown. This was quickly after me finishing Ad Astra and being depressed that there was no more Amicus, though FBTW did very quickly save me. During the second lockdown I was at my peak of brainrot, being obsessed with Kpop for one, and this big furry man through the screen caught me falling into another near-parasocial relationship. I would play kitsch-y classical music playlists on YouTube and play through the visual novel really trying to immerse myself totally into the game and the perspective of the playable character. 

With the game still being worked on and extensive chapters of the visual novel being released every year, Ranok is sustained husbando for myself and one I'll be closely attached to for a long time.
