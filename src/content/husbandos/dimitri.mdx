Dimitri Alexandre Blaiddyd is one of the main characters in Fire Emblem: Three Houses, serving as the leader of the Blue Lions faction and a potential love interest for the protagonist. As the crown prince of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus, he embodies everything you could want in a royal love interest: chivalrous, hardworking, honest to a fault, and blessed with that perfect blonde prince aesthetic. He's truly the quintessential noble hero—at least on the surface.

What makes Dimitri fascinating is the complexity beneath his princely exterior. His character development throughout the game reveals the depths of trauma that transform him from idealistic prince to tormented warrior vowing to exact revenge on his enemies, and vengeance for his family and comrades. 

Dimitri wasn't love at first sight. When I first heard of Three Houses, I was actually drawn to Claude with his suave charisma and cheeky personality. But the moment I started playing the prologue, something about Dimitri's earnest nature and quiet intensity completely won me over.

He ticks every single box on my ideal husbando checklist: royal prince, chivalrous, hardworking, honest to a fault, blonde, tall, and with that perfect twunk energy. Everything about him screams "perfect boyfriend material."

I bought Three Houses fully expecting that male Byleth could romance any male character. The crushing disappointment when I discovered Dimitri was only romanceable as female Byleth was devastating. I'd built up this entire fantasy of pursuing him as male Byleth, only to have it shattered by the game's limitations.

Even though you can't romance him as male Byleth, Dimitri still develops this incredibly close, caring, and attentive relationship with you. He gives you all the emotional intimacy and devotion you could want—everything except the romantic acknowledgment that would make it official. 

Despite this I was still obsessed with Dimitri. I consumed millions of words of fanfiction featuring Dimitri with various male characters—Byleth, Claude, Felix, and others. Every morning became a ritual: wake up, immediately open AO3, and search for the latest fics that matched my tastes.

My dedication didn't stop at reading. I became a dedicated collector of Dimitri fanart, scouring Twitter daily and building a folder that grew to nearly 500 images. I would play the game not for the story but specifically to spend time with him during tea time and gardening sessions. These small interactions helped feed my desire of spending time with him.

That obsessive phase has mellowed now, though Dimitri still holds a special place in my heart. I still check AO3 occasionally for new fanfics that catch my eye, and any good fanart of him gets immediately saved to my collection. 

I await the day where I can finally romance Dimitri as the male protagonist.
