Oh Minato. Another husbando in the same vein as Dimitri, Thoma, Kise, and Loid. Tall, blonde, handsome, strong, selfless and considerate. I remember stumbling across a fanfic of him and another character during my days of using fanfiction.net, and being so entranced with him (very much to do with the way the author wrote him, kudos to the author) that it almost changed me as a person. I would become obsessive with this fanfic and read it every couple months depsite being over 100k words. Stild I read it every so often to this day. 

Minato being a canonically powerful character in the show with his easy-going, nurturing personality made me fall for this man hard, and I despair that he's dead in the story's timeline, only getting glimpses of him in flashbacks. If there was ever a project to create something about his story I would fund it. 

I refuse to put a YouTube video compilation in here like I do with the other husbandos in this list as seeing Minato with Kushina brings out a demon in me and is probably the peak of my parasocial brainworms. Of course, I exagerate here but still. Likewise with merchandise and official art, most of these include Kushina.
