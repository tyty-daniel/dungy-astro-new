Seth Lowell from Zenless Zone Zero is an extremely loyal and principled character, devoted to his cause and a paragon of justice even to the dismay of those more corrupt that may be around him. When I first saw him in ZZZ, a silver-haired catboy twunk with buff arms, I immediately locked in on that entire game (along with Von Lycaon).
