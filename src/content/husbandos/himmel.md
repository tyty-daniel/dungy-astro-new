Himmel my LOVE I have this man in a wedding suit on my desk and each time I look at him I imagine him asking my hand for a dance and then we dance in the most lavish majestic ballroom in a castle while everyone watches us and I'm half tipsy and he's just smiling completely infatuated with me UGH. 

Again like my other husbandos he has the exact personality and character type I usually go for. Gentle, chivalrous, handsome, absolutely devoted to his love interest -- even better that she never noticed his feelings while he was still alive -- strong, and a leader. Being a knight in a high setting also helps tremendously, and the blue hair is in line with my lean towards lighter hair colours.

First watching Frieren, I was immediately attracted to him but quite hesitant with him potentially being the love interest of the main character, however with him being dead in the main storyline this dispelled that fear. I do admit that having a male character with an active love interest does kind of ruin the attraction for me.
