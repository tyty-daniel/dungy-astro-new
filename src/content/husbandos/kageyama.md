Kageyama was a character who had to grow on me. He's very much one where you come to really like him the more you find out about his character, and everything he does stems from his past experiences.

Post-time skip Kageyama grows out of his overly-moody character and into someone much more calm and relaxed, while also becoming much more attractive.
