Kagami is definitely one of my favourite husbandos. Watching Kuroko no Basuke when I was 13/14 years old I used to love the scenes of him with his top off. He has an almost-cocky, boyish attitude with a cute gap-moe of being scared of dogs. Combine that with being kind but a little thick and you've got a good himbo who's a little rough on the outside. 

I used to ship him with Kuroko and Akashi (and myself) and would read a lot of fanfiction of him, as well as save all the fanart of him I could find -- which is very little these days with KnB fading out of relevancy. 

I barely remember much about him now with me not watching KnB for years, though I do hold a very soft spot for him still to this day, and would definitely buy merchandise of him when given the chance.
