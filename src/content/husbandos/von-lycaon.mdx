During Zenless Zone Zero's initial marketing phase and character previews, Von Lycaon generated a stir online for being the first playable furry character in a Hoyoverse game and admittely a handsome wolf with an interesting design including leather straps. 

I had the fortunate chance of being in Tokyo when Zenless Zone Zero first came out, where typical of the marketing for these games, there were many large advertisement posters plastered in a collective manner in the popular streets in Akihabara. Excitedly sharing to my furry friend that this big furry hunk is being plastered in public places in Tokyo.

Von Lycaon, the leader of the playable group Victoria Housekeeping Co., is both reliable butler and effortless gentleman keen to provide a high-class service to the Proxy. Within cutscenes through the main story you can see his careful handling of Proxy's Bangboo, careful speech and suave voice, and chivalrous character with Proxy as well as to his own team somewhat. 

In the game, you are able to invite Von Lycaon out on - what are effectively - dates. Through these you can build up trust with the butler and overtime his speech towards you will be much more closer and warm-hearted, where at times it can teeter on a 'very close' relationship. I am currently actively playing Zenless Zone Zero and do often invite him onto dates, and have already achieved the maximum bond you can get with a character. 

## Merchandise 
I have purchased a dakimakura of him, which has replaced my Thoma dakimakura (for now). I also have some acrylic stands and badges of him.

## Birthday Meal!
Although Von Lycaon's favourite food has not been listed, I suspect it would be something like a steak done medium rare, with perhaps a side of vegetables and a glass of a delicate-tasting wine. I'll try making this on his birthday.
