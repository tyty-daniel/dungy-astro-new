I really do have a thing for blondes in anime. Atsumu, also another blonde, is very much a character like Kise in their playfulness, but way more expressive and sometimes grumpy that adds to his cuteness. 

I first watched Haikyuu in 2020 during the pandemic. Haikyuu has provided me with a range of husbandos, though I think the one I grew the most attached to was Atsumu. Atsumu appears in season 4 of Haikyuu as part of the main rival team of the season. 

Season 4 is split into two parts. The first part is very much the slice-of-life and character building part of the season, and all the scenes of him charmed me to his attitude and character. He is absolutely dedicated to volleyball, obsessed with it, and its that strong principle in him where despite everyone finding him weird he will still stay dedicated to what he loves, is what really drove me towards him. 

His interactions with Hinata also added towards this too. In Hinata, Atsumu finally felt like he found his missing piece in volleyball. This admiration turned devotion to Hinata in the story, and his declaration of setting for him, helped swoon me over. 

I used to read tons of fanfiction of him after I finished Haikyuu, and I have hundreds of fanart of him saved on my computer now. Honestly, the amount of fanfiction I read of Haikyuu, but specifically Atsumu, is criminal. As soon as the next Haikyuu movie gets animated I'll get obsessed with him again.
