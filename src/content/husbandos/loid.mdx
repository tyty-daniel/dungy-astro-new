Loid Forger came out of nowhere for me when I started to watch Spy X Family. An intelligent, charming spy that also knows how to be a family man. He has peak husband physiognomy and personality which I am extremely attracted to, a la Minato, Thoma. 

Saying this I've stopped watching SPY X FAMILY already, I found the show to be extremely boring going into season 2 and as much as I loved Loid I just really couldn't keep watching it when he doesn't have as much screentime as Anya and Yor. 

Saying this, when I see him I go feral with him being my exact type. Love me a blonde man. 

## Merchandise
import ImageGrid from '../../components/ImageGrid.astro';

I have two figures of Loid Forger, one in his casual outfit and one in his suit. I bought both online from different stores. I honestly like both of these very much, where the casual outfit is much more laidback and domestic that I have on my desk at all times, while the suit figure is more formal which I do also enjoy, though i have this on my bookshelf.
