Prince Sidon of The Legend of Zelda is possibly my first "furry" (actually scalie if we're being pedantic) husbando. Sidon is possible the most attentive and 'dog-like' character out of my husbandos -- very ironic being a fish!

Prince Sidon first appears in Breath of the Wild, your main partner during the Zora part of the story. In his first scene he towers over Link as if intimidating and overwhelming with his pure size, but immediately shoots his arms out in welcoming Link. Throughout the story he showers Link in admiration and applause, as if anything Link does astonishes him in amazement and he does not shy away from showing this. 

This, on top of his physical attractiveness (just look at the man... or fish) is why he was my top husbando in the year BoTW came out. I don't want to measure the amount of fanfiction I read of Sidon and Link, and how much fanart I saved of Sidon. He is everything one would want in a husband, and he is therefore high in my tier list of husbandos. 

_I will update this when the new Zelda film comes out, as this is based on Breath of the Wild, so would be very interested to see how they portray Sidon._
