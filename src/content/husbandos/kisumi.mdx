Kisumi is one of my longest husbandos of over 10 years, and possibly the most important to me. Although maybe not my top favourite anymore (which is now Thoma), he's still second and I have a very fond affection towards him.

Kisumi first appeared in episode 7 of Free! Eternal Summer. During the time this was being released I just turned 14 and going into year 10 in high school. Everyday I would browse the anime board on 4chan, being the height of my weeb years, and was culturally sucked into more "mature" chan culture as a 14 year old could get. ("mature" chan culture in this instance meaning not laughing at lolcows or finding anything on b or pol funny). 

Every week I would browse the threads for each new Free! episode when this was being released, as this was, to me, where all the cool funny people were in the same interests as me - hot animated swimmer men. This is where I saw Kisumi first appear and everyone spamming the threads with pictures of him with the post text being "KISSME KISUMI". 

I'm generally attracted to a dog-like personality which Kisumi definitely has, and I'm also a sucker for light-coloured hair - with Kisumi probably creating something in me to like pink hair. Kisumi has a very playful and teasing personality, especially towards Haruka, which I found very endearing. His design, that of a tall and athletic body with pink hair and soft smile, locked me in at the age of 14 and I'm still zoned in 11 years later.

Since seeing Kisumi and being bombarded with KISSME KISUMI I was completely zoned in on him. I would rewatch the same scenes of him in his episodes. I'd constantly have a picture of him on my desktop at all times, and constantly be checking AO3 for fanfiction including him and Haruka and/or Makoto.

I remember looking for art for him would be annoying because no one would make any, with him being a side character. I would search scour /cm/, Pixiv, Gelbooru and other boorus for any art of him. Browsing the desktop threads on /g/, seeing a poster have Kisumi as their standard anime picture I would feel a kind of camaraderie with them, knowing I wasn't alone in this infatuation with him in the world. Every year I would watch his episodes on his birthday. I remember when the 3rd season of Free! came out and going absolutely insane when he showed up again after 4 years from season 2. Feral.

I even remember writing fanfiction of myself and him, fantasising a cyberpunk setting listening to t e l e p a t h.
