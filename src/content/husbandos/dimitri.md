Dimitri is one of the main characters in Fire Emblem: Three Houses, leader of the Blue Lions faction, and a potential love-interest for your character. Before I bought the game, I wasn't immediately drawn to Dimitri, but in fact Claude for his suave charismatic and cheeky character, though playing the prologue Dimitri very quickly grew on me.

Dimitri pretty much ticks all the boxes for what I like: a royal prince, chivalrous, hard-working, honest to a fault, blonde twunk, tall, the list goes on. When you choose the male protagonist, you cannot romance Dimitri, however Dimitri still fosters a very close relationship with you -- extremely caring and attentive. I was absolutely heartbroken when I found out this fact, as I bought the game with the idea that the male protagonist can have romantic relationships with absolutely any male character, to the point where I barely touched the game after. 

Saying this I still loved my time playing the game and, of course, my time with him. The sheer volume of fanfiction I read of him and another male character (Byleth, Claude, Felix, etc.) was in the millions of words easily. Every morning I would wake up and immediately open AO3 to find the latest fanfiction that was to my tastes. I would check Twitter and download all of the Dimitri fanart I could find -- where my folder grew to almost 500 images. I would frequently open up the game only to do the tea time and gardening with him (and the other male characters I found attractive... but mostly him) to help give me the feeling of interacting with him as a person. 

This obsessive infatuation is over now, though I still check AO3 for any good new fanfics of him every now and then, and when I see art of him I still immediately save it. It makes me sad that there won't be any more official content of him, though I think most of the time a character will have their time and place.
