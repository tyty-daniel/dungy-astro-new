Kise Ryouta is very easily one of my first husbandos (alongside [Kagami](/husbandos/kagami) and [Aomine](/husbandos/aomine) in Kuruko no Basuke) and has a character type that's very typical for my collection of husbandos: blonde, tall, athlete/sporty, puppy-dog personality. Very much a character like Thoma or Kisumi. 

This super-affectionate and playful personality of his, as well as being tall and blonde, helped really attract me to him to a concerning degree when I first watched this in high school. To put it crudely, he was the perfect top for when I would self-insert as Kuroko or Akashi when reading fanfiction or just daydreaming at the time.
