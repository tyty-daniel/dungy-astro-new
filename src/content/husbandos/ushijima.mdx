Ushijima appears in the second season of Haikyuu!! as a future 'antagonist' (for lack of a better term), and I remember being immediately attracted to his tall, muscular figure with that standoff-ish, quiet but straight-talking allure that I find attractive at times. His quiet but powerful figure reminded me of Zoro somewhat. He, like Zoro, have the gap moe of being a little dumb at times and a cute personality, though both having very strong principles that they stand by. 

Some of his trivia adds to this, for example with him now playing in Poland his main concern is that "he wants to learn foreign languages".

I remember that I used to read fanfic of him before even seeing him in Haikyuu!!. He had a lot of art when the second season aired back in 2016, though I only truly watched Haikyuu in 2021.

## Trivia 
Ushijima's favourite food is hayashi rice, which is a Japanese dish consisting of beef, onions, and mushrooms in a thick demi-glace sauce served over rice. This is a dish for the cold weather, and I will make this one cold weekend for him, with a picture of him on my kitchen counter while I cook the dish.
