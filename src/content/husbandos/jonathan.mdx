I first watched Jojo's Bizarre Adventure in 2015 when I finished high school, and binged all of the first season in a couple of days. 

Jonathan Joestar only shows up in the first arc, but his gentlemanly and kind nature combined with his huge stature and masculine design made me head over heels for him. I went straight to Gelbooru to download all the fanart I could find of him
